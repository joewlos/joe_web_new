<p>"<a href="https://medium.com/@joewlos/uncommon-carriers-the-effective-regulation-of-net-neutrality-4c090059adae#.5svj1erl8" target="_blank">Uncommon Carriers</a>" examines the quirky historical development of common carrier status and explains the FCC’s net neutrality enforcement failures. The paper won Grinnell College’s 2015 <a href="http://magazine.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/cls/students/fellowships-awards/grinnell-specific" target="_blank">Baumann Prize</a> for the exploration of ideas and society in an interdisciplinary context.</p>
